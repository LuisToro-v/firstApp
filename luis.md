Design:
![Luis' Design](design.PNG)
Pro: 
* Relationship and multiplicity is well represented.
* Creating a separate class for Checked off items.
* ID are useful in classes so that we can access instances more easily.
* 


Con: 
* In user class, we do not need to include  the create or delete user method in the design.
* In CheckedOffItem, there should be an attribute that indicates if the item is checkedOff.
* Needs a method that allows the user to create and delete a list.
* In ItemType, createType and delete type is unnecessary. 
* There should a relationship between CheckedOffItem and Item.
